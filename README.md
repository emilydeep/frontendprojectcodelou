## Description
```
This a website for a local business, Lambert's Auto Body Shop. They currently do not have a website, so I was building one from scratch to give them the opportunity to be found online. I used jQuery, Bootstrap, and custom CSS to make the website responsive. 

```



## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

1. .jumbotron: This added a hero image to my website. Combined with the inline Bootstrap, the image is responsive.

2. .topnav a:hover : This class added a yellow background color when the mouse hovers or clicks on the top navigation links.

3. .topnav a : This is where I style the top navigation bar/links. I changed the font, color, size, padding, and alignment.

```



## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1. $('.icon').on('click', (function() : This function hides the mobile menu icon on large screens (i.e. desktops). Then when the browser breaks to 800px or less; the mobile menu is displayed, while the navigation links are hidden until the mobile icon is clicked.

```
